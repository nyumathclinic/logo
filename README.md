Logo art for the NYU Math Clinic

![Purple Plus Logo](https://github.com/nyumathclinic/logo/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true)

The file `logo.tex` generates PDF and PNG version of the logo.

The idea is a play on words: "Clinical Faculty" evokes a health clinic; we are the
Math Clinic.  The Red Cross logo is a symbol of medical care.  We can use the "Purple
Plus."
